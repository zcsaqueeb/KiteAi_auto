# Kite AI Automation

Kite AI Automation is a Python script that automates interactions with Kite AI agents for coding assistance and cryptocurrency analysis. It manages daily interactions, analyzes transactions, and provides customizable questions, all while offering a user-friendly interface to enhance productivity and streamline AI support.

## Features

- **Automated Agent Interaction**: Seamlessly interact with multiple AI agents.
- **Daily Points Management**: Track and manage daily interaction points.
- **Transaction Analysis**: Fetch and analyze recent cryptocurrency transactions.
- **Customizable Questions**: Use predefined questions tailored for each AI agent.
- **User -Friendly Interface**: Clear, structured output with color-coded messages.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - `requests`
  - `colorama`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kite-ai-automation.git
   cd kite-ai-automation
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install requests colorama
   ```

3. **Create a wallet address file**:
   - Create a file named `address.txt` in the same directory as the script.
   - Add your registered wallet addresses, one per line.

## Usage

1. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   python new.py
   ```

2. **Monitor the output**:
   - The script will read wallet addresses from `address.txt` and process each account sequentially.
   - It will interact with the AI agents and provide structured output in the console.

3. **Stop the script**:
   - You can stop the script at any time by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

## Configuration

- The script automatically fetches the latest agent configuration from the Kite AI platform. If no agents are available, it will revert to using fallback agents.
- You can customize the questions used for each agent in the `generate_questions_for_agent` method within the script.
